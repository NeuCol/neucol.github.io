The NeuCol collaboration uses and develops a variety of software tools, including:

[ACHILLES](https://github.com/AchillesGen/Achilles)
 (A CHIcago Land Lepton Event Simulator) is a modern theory driven lepton event generator.

[MCFM](https://mcfm.fnal.gov/)
 is a parton-level Monte Carlo program that gives predictions for a
wide range of processes at hadron colliders.

[SHERPA](https://sherpa-team.gitlab.io/)
 is a Monte Carlo event generator for the Simulation of High-Energy Reactions of PArticles in lepton-lepton, lepton-photon, photon-photon, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions.
