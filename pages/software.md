The NeuCol collaboration uses and develops a variety of software tools, including:

[ACHILLES](https://github.com/AchillesGen/Achilles)
 (A CHIcago Land Lepton Event Simulator), a modern theory driven lepton event generator.

[MCFM](https://mcfm.fnal.gov/),
 a parton-level Monte Carlo program that gives predictions for a
wide range of processes at hadron colliders.

[PEPPER](https://gitlab.com/spice-mc/pepper)
 (Portable Engine for the Production of Parton-level Event Records),
 an efficent parton-level event generator to simulate high-energy physics at colliders such as the LHC.

[SHERPA](https://sherpa-team.gitlab.io/),
 a Monte Carlo event generator for the Simulation of High-Energy Reactions of PArticles in lepton-lepton, lepton-photon, photon-photon, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions.

[CodeScribe](https://github.com/akashdhruv/CodeScribe),
 a tool designed to facilitate incremental translation of Fortran codebases into C++ using generative AI.
