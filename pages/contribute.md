# Contribution Policies

We encourage code contributions from the community. Contributors with
read only permission should use the following guidelines to create a
pull request:

- Create a fork.
- Make your changes.
- Create a PR branch whenever you wish.
  Give your PR a title that begins with the word "Draft".
  This will allow any discussion about the pull
  request to be conducted on github.
- When you are ready for the pull request to be accepted, merge from **main**
into your forked code, to ensure that your fork is not out of sync.
- Run a local version of your test suite and make sure everything
passes.
- Make sure your latest commit has been pushed.
- Remove "Draft" from your pull request name. If no further problems
are found, this will cause the PR
to be merged.
